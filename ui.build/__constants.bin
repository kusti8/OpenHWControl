        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Cache" to the base app data dir for Windows. See
            discussion below.

    Typical user cache directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Caches/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName> (XDG default)
        Win XP:     C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache
        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings go in
    the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. This is identical to the non-roaming
    app data dir (the default returned by `user_data_dir` above). Apps typically
    put cache data somewhere *under* the given dir here. Some examples:
        ...\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<ProfileName>\Cache
        ...\Acme\SuperApp\Cache\1.0
    OPINION: This function appends "Cache" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` value.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.
    Return full path to the user-specific log dir for this application.

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Logs" to the base app data dir for Windows, and "log" to the
            base cache dir for Unix. See discussion below.

    Typical user log directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Logs/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName>/log  # or under $XDG_CACHE_HOME if defined
        Win XP:     C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Logs
        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Logs

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings
    go in the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. (Note: I'm interested in
    examples of what some windows apps use for a logs dir.)

    OPINION: This function appends "Logs" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA`
    value for Windows and appends "log" to the user cache dir for Unix.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.

            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "roaming" (boolean, default False) can be set True to use the Windows
            roaming appdata directory. That means that for users on a Windows
            network setup for roaming profiles, this user data will be
            sync'd on login. See
            <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766489(WS.10).aspx>

    Convert a 3-tuple of integers, suitable for use in an ``rgb()``
    color triplet, to a normalized hexadecimal value for that color.

    
    Convert a 3-tuple of integers, suitable for use in an ``rgb()``
    color triplet, to a 3-tuple of percentages suitable for use in
    representing that color.

    This function makes some trade-offs in terms of the accuracy of
    the final representation; for some common integer values,
    special-case logic is used to ensure a precise result (e.g.,
    integer 128 will always convert to '50%', integer 32 will always
    convert to '12.5%'), but for all other values a standard Python
    ``float`` is used and rounded to two decimal places, which may
    result in a loss of precision for some values.

    normalize_percent_triplet.<locals>.<genexpr>{}%{:.02f}%
    Internal helper for converting a percentage value to an integer
    between 0 and 255 inclusive.

    '{}' is not a valid hexadecimal color value.css3_names_to_hexHTML5 legacy color parsing forbids empty string as a value.
    Convert a hexadecimal color value to a 3-tuple of percentages
    suitable for use in an ``rgb()`` triplet representing that color.

    
    Convert a 3-tuple of percentages, suitable for use in an ``rgb()``
    color triplet, to a normalized hexadecimal color value for that
    color.

    
    Convert a color name to a normalized hexadecimal color value.

    The optional keyword argument ``spec`` determines which
    specification's list of color names will be used; valid values are
    ``html4``, ``css2``, ``css21`` and ``css3``, and the default is
    ``css3``.

    When no color of that name exists in the given specification,
    ``ValueError`` is raised.

    name_to_hexHTML5 legacy color parsing requires a Unicode string as input.An HTML5 simple color must be a Unicode string exactly seven characters long.SUPPORTED_SPECIFICATIONS
    Convert a 3-tuple of percentages, suitable for use in an ``rgb()``
    color triplet, to a 3-tuple of integers suitable for use in
    representing that color.

    Some precision may be lost in this conversion. See the note
    regarding precision for ``rgb_to_rgb_percent()`` for details.

    An HTML5 simple color must contain exactly six ASCII hex digits.
    Apply the simple color parsing algorithm from section 2.4.6 of
    HTML5.

            Ignored if `input` is ``False``.
        :param output_device_index:
            Index of Output Device to use.
            Unspecified (or ``None``) uses the default device.
            Ignored if `output` is ``False``.
        :param frames_per_buffer: Specifies the number of frames per buffer.
        :param start: Start the stream running immediately.
            Defaults to ``True``. In general, there is no reason to set
            this to ``False``.
        :param input_host_api_specific_stream_info: Specifies a host API
            specific stream information data structure for input.

            .. only:: pamac

               See :py:class:`PaMacCoreStreamInfo`.

        :param output_host_api_specific_stream_info: Specifies a host API
            specific stream information data structure for output.

            .. only:: pamac

               See :py:class:`PaMacCoreStreamInfo`.

        :param stream_callback: Specifies a callback function for
            *non-blocking* (callback) operation.  Default is
            ``None``, which indicates *blocking* operation (i.e.,
            :py:func:`Stream.read` and :py:func:`Stream.write`).  To use
            non-blocking operation, specify a callback that conforms
            to the following signature:

            .. code-block:: python

               callback(in_data,      # recorded data if input=True; else None
                        frame_count,  # number of frames
                        time_info,    # dictionary
                        status_flags) # PaCallbackFlags

            ``time_info`` is a dictionary with the following keys:
            ``input_buffer_adc_time``, ``current_time``, and
            ``output_buffer_dac_time``; see the PortAudio
            documentation for their meanings.  ``status_flags`` is one
            of |PaCallbackFlags|.

            The callback must return a tuple:

            .. code-block:: python

                (out_data, flag)

            ``out_data`` is a byte array whose length should be the
            (``frame_count * channels * bytes-per-channel``) if
            ``output=True`` or ``None`` if ``output=False``.  ``flag``
            must be either :py:data:`paContinue`, :py:data:`paComplete` or
            :py:data:`paAbort` (one of |PaCallbackReturnCodes|).
            When ``output=True`` and ``out_data`` does not contain at
            least ``frame_count`` frames, :py:data:`paComplete` is
            assumed for ``flag``.

            **Note:** ``stream_callback`` is called in a separate
            thread (from the main thread).  Exceptions that occur in
            the ``stream_callback`` will:

            1. print a traceback on standard error to aid debugging,
            2. queue the exception to be thrown (at some point) in
               the main thread, and
            3. return `paAbort` to PortAudio to stop the stream.

            **Note:** Do not call :py:func:`Stream.read` or
            :py:func:`Stream.write` if using non-blocking operation.

            **See:** PortAudio's callback signature for additional
            details: http://portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/portaudio_8h.html#a8a60fb2a5ec9cbade3f54a9c978e2710

        :raise ValueError: Neither input nor output are set True.
        
        Read samples from the stream.  Do not call when using
        *non-blocking* mode.

        :param num_frames: The number of frames to read.
        :param exception_on_overflow:
           Specifies whether an IOError exception should be thrown
           (or silently ignored) on input buffer overflow. Defaults
           to True.
        :raises IOError: if stream is not an input stream
          or if the read operation was unsuccessful.
        :rtype: string
        
        Return a dictionary containing the Host API parameters for the
        host API specified by the `host_api_index`. The keys of the
        dictionary mirror the data fields of PortAudio's ``PaHostApiInfo``
        structure.

PyAudio provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross-platform
audio I/O library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and
record audio on a variety of platforms.  PyAudio is inspired by:

* pyPortAudio/fastaudio: Python bindings for PortAudio v18 API.
* tkSnack: cross-platform sound toolkit for Tcl/Tk and Python.

    :rtype: string
    defaultOutputDevice    Get an instance of the Serial class, depending on port/url. The port is not
    opened when the keyword parameter 'do_not_open' is true, by default it
    is. All other parameters are directly passed to the __init__ method when
    the port is instantiated.

    The list of package names that is searched for protocol handlers is kept in
    ``protocol_handler_packages``.

    e.g. we want to support a URL ``foobar://``. A module
    ``my_handlers.protocol_foobar`` is provided by the user. Then
    ``protocol_handler_packages.append("my_handlers")`` would extend the search
    path so that ``serial_for_url("foobar://"))`` would work.

        dev_handle is the value returned by the open_device() method.
        The ep parameter is the bEndpointAddress field whose endpoint
        the data will be received from. intf is the bInterfaceNumber field
        of the interface containing the endpoint. The buff parameter
        is the buffer to receive the data read, the length of the buffer
        tells how many bytes should be read.  The timeout parameter

        The method returns the number of bytes actually read.
        IBackend.close_deviceBackend interface.

    IBackend is the basic interface for backend implementations. By default,
    the methods of the interface raise a NotImplementedError exception. A
    backend implementation should replace the methods to provide the funcionality
    necessary.

    As Python is a dynamic typed language, you are not obligated to inherit from
    IBackend: everything that behaves like an IBackend is an IBackend. But you
    are strongly recommended to do so, inheriting from IBackend provides consistent
    default behavior.
    IBackend.iso_writeIBackend.claim_interfacePerform an isochronous write.

        dev_handle is the value returned by the open_device() method.
        The ep parameter is the bEndpointAddress field whose endpoint
        the data will be sent to. intf is the bInterfaceNumber field
        of the interface containing the endpoint. The data parameter
        is the data to be sent. It must be an instance of the array.array
        class. The timeout parameter specifies a time limit to the operation
        in miliseconds.

        The method returns the number of bytes written.
        IBackend.get_configurationPerform an interrupt write.

        dev_handle is the value returned by the open_device() method.
        The ep parameter is the bEndpointAddress field whose endpoint
        the data will be sent to. intf is the bInterfaceNumber field
        of the interface containing the endpoint. The data parameter
        is the data to be sent. It must be an instance of the array.array
        class. The timeout parameter specifies a time limit to the operation
        in miliseconds.

        The method returns the number of bytes written.
        IBackend.reset_deviceIBackend.get_device_descriptorIBackend.is_kernel_driver_activeRe-attach an interface's kernel driver, which was previously
        detached using detach_kernel_driver().IBackend.clear_haltReturn an endpoint descriptor of the given device.

        The object returned is required to have all the Endpoint Descriptor
        fields acessible as member variables. They must be convertible (but
        not required to be equal) to the int type.

        The ep parameter is the endpoint logical index (not the bEndpointAddress
        field) of the endpoint descriptor desired. dev, intf, alt and config are the same
        values already described in the get_interface_descriptor() method.
        IBackend.bulk_readRelease the claimed interface.

        dev_handle and intf are the same parameters of the claim_interface
        method.
        _not_implementedOpen the device for data exchange.

        This method opens the device identified by the dev parameter for communication.
        This method must be called before calling any communication related method, such
        as transfer methods.

        It returns a handle identifying the communication instance. This handle must be
        passed to the communication methods.
        Return an interface descriptor of the given device.

        The object returned is required to have all the Interface Descriptor
        fields accessible as member variables. They must be convertible (but
        not required to be equal) to the int type.

        The dev parameter is the device identification object.
        The intf parameter is the interface logical index (not the bInterfaceNumber field)
        and alt is the alternate setting logical index (not the bAlternateSetting value).
        Not every interface has more than one alternate setting.  In this case, the alt
        parameter should be zero. config is the configuration logical index (not the
        bConfigurationValue field).
        IBackend.bulk_writePerform a bulk write.

        dev_handle is the value returned by the open_device() method.
        The ep parameter is the bEndpointAddress field whose endpoint
        the data will be sent to. intf is the bInterfaceNumber field
        of the interface containing the endpoint. The data parameter
        is the data to be sent. It must be an instance of the array.array
        class. The timeout parameter specifies a time limit to the operation
        in miliseconds.

        The method returns the number of bytes written.
        This function is required to return an iterable object which
        yields an implementation defined device identification for each
        USB device found in the system.

        The device identification object is used as argument to other methods
        of the interface.
        Return the device descriptor of the given device.

        The object returned is required to have all the Device Descriptor
        fields accessible as member variables. They must be convertible (but
        not required to be equal) to the int type.

        dev is an object yielded by the iterator returned by the enumerate_devices()
        method.
        IBackend.get_interface_descriptorGet the current active device configuration.

        This method returns the bConfigurationValue of the currently
        active configuration. Depending on the backend and the OS,
        either a cached value may be returned or a control request may
        be issued. The dev_handle parameter is the value returned by
        the open_device method.
        Detach a kernel driver from an interface.

        If successful, you will then be able to claim the interface
        and perform I/O.
        IBackend.intr_writeDetermine if a kernel driver is active on an interface.

        If a kernel driver is active, you cannot claim the interface,
        and the backend will be unable to perform I/O.
        IBackend.detach_kernel_driverIBackend.iso_readIBackend.ctrl_transferClose the device handle.

        This method closes the device communication channel and releases any
        system resources related to it.
        Clear the halt/stall condition for the endpoint.Perform a bulk read.

        dev_handle is the value returned by the open_device() method.
        The ep parameter is the bEndpointAddress field whose endpoint
        the data will be received from. intf is the bInterfaceNumber field
        of the interface containing the endpoint. The buff parameter
        is the buffer to receive the data read, the length of the buffer
        tells how many bytes should be read. The timeout parameter
        specifies a time limit to the operation in miliseconds.

        The method returns the number of bytes actually read.
        Claim the given interface.

        Interface claiming is not related to USB spec itself, but it is
        generally an necessary call of the USB libraries. It requests exclusive
        access to the interface on the system. This method must be called
        before using one of the transfer methods.

        dev_handle is the value returned by the open_device() method and
        intf is the bInterfaceNumber field of the desired interface.
        Perform a control transfer on the endpoint 0.

        The direction of the transfer is inferred from the bmRequestType
        field of the setup packet.

        dev_handle is the value returned by the open_device() method.
        bmRequestType, bRequest, wValue and wIndex are the same fields
        of the setup packet. data is an array object, for OUT requests
        it contains the bytes to transmit in the data stage and for
        IN requests it is the buffer to hold the data read. The number
        of bytes requested to transmit or receive is equal to the length
        of the array times the data.itemsize field. The timeout parameter
        specifies a time limit to the operation in miliseconds.

        Return the number of bytes written (for OUT transfers) or the data
        read (for IN transfers), as an array.array object.
        usb.backend - Backend interface.

This module exports:

IBackend - backend interface.

Backends are Python objects which implement the IBackend interface.
The easiest way to do so is inherinting from IBackend.

PyUSB already provides backends for libusb versions 0.1 and 1.0,
and OpenUSB library. Backends modules included with PyUSB are required to
export the get_backend() function, which returns an instance of a backend
object. You can provide your own customized backend if you
want to. Below you find a skeleton of a backend implementation module:

import usb.backend

class MyBackend(usb.backend.IBackend):
    pass

def get_backend():
    return MyBackend()

You can use your customized backend by passing it as the backend parameter of the
usb.core.find() function. For example:

import custom_backend
import usb.core

myidVendor = 0xfffe
myidProduct = 0x0001

mybackend = custom_backend.get_backend()

dev = usb.core.find(backend = mybackend, idProduct=myidProduct,
                    idVendor=myidVendor)

For custom backends, you are not required to supply the get_backend() function,
since the application code will instantiate the backend.

If you do not provide a backend to the find() function, it will use one of the
defaults backend according to its internal rules. For details, consult the
find() function documentation.
Set the interface alternate setting.

        This method should only be called when the interface has more than
        one alternate setting. The dev_handle is the value returned by the
        open_device() method. intf and altsetting are respectivelly the
        bInterfaceNumber and bAlternateSetting fields of the related interface.
        IBackend.get_endpoint_descriptorIBackend.release_interfaceReturn a configuration descriptor of the given device.

        The object returned is required to have all the Configuration Descriptor
        fields acessible as member variables. They must be convertible (but
        not required to be equal) to the int type.

        The dev parameter is the device identification object.
        config is the logical index of the configuration (not the bConfigurationValue
        field).  By "logical index" we mean the relative order of the configurations
        returned by the peripheral as a result of GET_DESCRIPTOR request.
        IBackend.get_configuration_descriptorIBackend.set_configurationIBackend.enumerate_devicesSet the active device configuration.

        This method should be called to set the active configuration
        of the device. The dev_handle parameter is the value returned
        by the open_device() method and the config_value parameter is the
        bConfigurationValue field of the related configuration descriptor.

tmoDevice.__getitem__DEVICE ID %04x:%04x on Bus %03d Address %03d_DescriptorInfoFind an USB device and return it.

    find() is the function used to discover USB devices.  You can pass as
    arguments any combination of the USB Device Descriptor fields to match a
    device. For example:

    find(idVendor=0x3f4, idProduct=0x2009)

    will return the Device object for the device with idVendor field equals
    to 0x3f4 and idProduct equals to 0x2009.

    If there is more than one device which matchs the criteria, the first one
    found will be returned. If a matching device cannot be found the function
    returns None. If you want to get all devices, you can set the parameter
    find_all to True, then find will return an iterator with all matched devices.
    If no matching device is found, it will return an empty iterator. Example:

    for printer in find(find_all=True, bDeviceClass=7):
        print (printer)

    This call will get all the USB printers connected to the system.  (actually
    may be not, because some devices put their class information in the
    Interface Descriptor).

    You can also use a customized match criteria:

    dev = find(custom_match = lambda d: d.idProduct=0x3f4 and d.idvendor=0x2009)

    A more accurate printer finder using a customized match would be like
    so:

    def is_printer(dev):
        import usb.util
        if dev.bDeviceClass == 7:
            return True
        for cfg in dev:
            if usb.util.find_descriptor(cfg, bInterfaceClass=7) is not None:
                return True

    for printer in find(find_all=True, custom_match = is_printer):
        print (printer)

    Now even if the device class code is in the interface descriptor the
    printer will be found.

    You can combine a customized match with device descriptor fields. In this
    case, the fields must match and the custom_match must return True. In the
    our previous example, if we would like to get all printers belonging to the
    manufacturer 0x3f4, the code would be like so:

    printers = list(find(find_all=True, idVendor=0x3f4, custom_match=is_printer))

    If you want to use find as a 'list all devices' function, just call
    it with find_all = True:

    devices = list(find(find_all=True))

    Finally, you can pass a custom backend to the find function:

    find(backend = MyBackend())

    PyUSB has builtin backends for libusb 0.1, libusb 1.0 and OpenUSB.  If you
    do not supply a backend explicitly, find() function will select one of the
    predefineds backends according to system availability.

    Backends are explained in the usb.backend module.
    _ResourceManager.managed_set_configuration.<locals>.MockConfigurationInitialize the Device object.

        Library users should normally get a Device instance through
        the find function. The dev parameter is the identification
        of a device to the backend and its meaning is opaque outside
        of it. The backend parameter is a instance of a backend
        object.

Endpoint - a class representing an endpoint descriptor.
find() - a function to find USB devices.
show_devices() - a function to show the devices present.
Device.__get_timeoutUnknown Class     %-19s:%#7x
Set the active configuration.

        The configuration parameter is the bConfigurationValue field of the
        configuration you want to set as active. If you call this method
        without parameter, it will use the first configuration found.  As a
        device hardly ever has more than one configuration, calling the method
        without arguments is enough to get the device ready.
        Represent an endpoint object.

    This class contains all fields of the Endpoint Descriptor according to the
    USB Specification. You can access them as class properties. For example, to
    access the field bEndpointAddress of the endpoint descriptor, you can do so:

    >>> import usb.core
    >>> dev = usb.core.find()
    >>> for cfg in dev:
    >>>     for i in cfg:
    >>>         for e in i:
    >>>             print e.bEndpointAddress
    Device.configurationsDevice.manufacturerthreading Return the USB device's serial number string descriptor.

        This property will cause some USB traffic the first time it is accessed
        and cache the resulting value for future use.
        Return the Interface object in the given position.

        index is a tuple of two values with interface index and
        alternate setting index, respectivally. Example:

        >>> interface = config[(0, 0)]
         %-23s:%#7x USB %d.%d%s
_active_cfg_indexNo backend availableInitialize the configuration object.

        The device parameter is the device object returned by the find()
        function. The configuration parameter is the logical index of the
        configuration (not the bConfigurationValue field). By "logical index"
        we mean the relative order of the configurations returned by the
        peripheral as a result of GET_DESCRIPTOR request.
        Default timeout for transfer I/O functions%s, %s
Set this configuration as the active one.Interface.__getitem__Device.set_interface_altsettingDo a control transfer on the endpoint 0.

        This method is used to issue a control transfer over the endpoint 0
        (endpoint 0 is required to always be a control endpoint).

        The parameters bmRequestType, bRequest, wValue and wIndex are the same
        of the USB Standard Control Request format.

        Control requests may or may not have a data payload to write/read.
        In cases which it has, the direction bit of the bmRequestType
        field is used to infer the desired request direction. For
        host to device requests (OUT), data_or_wLength parameter is
        the data payload to send, and it must be a sequence type convertible
        to an array object. In this case, the return value is the number
        of bytes written in the data payload. For device to host requests
        (IN), data_or_wLength is either the wLength parameter of the control
        request specifying the number of bytes to read in data payload, and
        the return value is an array object with data read, or an array
        object which the data will be read to, and the return value is the
        number of bytes read.
        Device.langidsShow information about connected devices.

    The verbose flag sets to verbose or not.
    **kwargs are passed directly to the find() function.
    wrapsDetach a kernel driver.

        If successful, you will then be able to perform I/O.

        The interface parameter is the device interface number to detach the
        driver from.

Endpoint.clear_haltRepresent a configuration object.

    This class contains all fields of the Configuration Descriptor according to
    the USB Specification. You may access them as class properties.  For
    example, to access the field bConfigurationValue of the configuration
    descriptor, you can do so:

    >>> import usb.core
    >>> dev = usb.core.find()
    >>> for cfg in dev:
    >>>     print cfg.bConfigurationValue
    Device object.

    This class contains all fields of the Device Descriptor according to the
    USB Specification. You may access them as class properties.  For example,
    to access the field bDescriptorType of the device descriptor, you can
    do so:

    >>> import usb.core
    >>> dev = usb.core.find()
    >>> dev.bDescriptorType

    Additionally, the class provides methods to communicate with the hardware.
    Typically, an application will first call the set_configuration() method to
    put the device in a known configured state, optionally call the
    set_interface_altsetting() to select the alternate setting (if there is
    more than one) of the interface used, and call the write() and read()
    methods to send and receive data, respectively.

    When working in a new hardware, the first try could be like this:

    >>> import usb.core
    >>> dev = usb.core.find(idVendor=myVendorId, idProduct=myProductId)
    >>> dev.set_configuration()
    >>> dev.write(1, 'test')

    This sample finds the device of interest (myVendorId and myProductId should
    be replaced by the corresponding values of your device), then configures
    the device (by default, the configuration value is 1, which is a typical
    value for most devices) and then writes some data to the endpoint 0x01.

    Timeout values for the write, read and ctrl_transfer methods are specified
    in miliseconds. If the parameter is omitted, Device.default_timeout value
    will be used instead. This property can be set by the user at anytime.
    Initialize the object.

        This initializes the USBError object. The strerror and errno are passed
        to the parent object. The error_code parameter is attributed to the
        backend_error_code member variable.
         Return the USB device's supported language ID codes.

        These are 16-bit codes familiar to Windows developers, where for
        example instead of en-US you say 0x0409. USB_LANGIDS.pdf on the usb.org
        developer site for more info. String requests using a LANGID not
        in this array should not be sent to the device.

        This property will cause some USB traffic the first time it is accessed
        and cache the resulting value for future use.

Clear the halt/status condition of the endpoint._ResourceManager.managed_openInterface._get_full_descriptor_strReturn a tuple of the device configurations.Endpoint.__repr__Read data from the endpoint.

        This method is used to receive data from the device. The endpoint
        parameter corresponds to the bEndpointAddress member whose endpoint
        you want to communicate with. The size_or_buffer parameter either
        tells how many bytes you want to read or supplies the buffer to
        receive the data (it *must* be an object of the type array).

        The timeout is specified in miliseconds.

        If the size_or_buffer parameter is the number of bytes to read, the
        method returns an array object with the data read. If the
        size_or_buffer parameter is an array object, it returns the number
        of bytes actually read.
        Represent an interface object.

    This class contains all fields of the Interface Descriptor
    according to the USB Specification. You may access them as class
    properties. For example, to access the field bInterfaceNumber
    of the interface descriptor, you can do so:

    >>> import usb.core
    >>> dev = usb.core.find()
    >>> for cfg in dev:
    >>>     for i in cfg:
    >>>         print i.bInterfaceNumber
    Device.__repr__   %-21s:%#7x (%d mA)Device.productDevice._get_full_descriptor_str_Device__default_timeoutSet the alternate setting for an interface.

        When you want to use an interface and it has more than one alternate
        setting, you should call this method to select the appropriate
        alternate setting. If you call the method without one or the two
        parameters, it will be selected the first one found in the Device in
        the same way of the set_configuration method.

        Commonly, an interface has only one alternate setting and this call is
        not necessary. For most devices, either it has more than one
        alternate setting or not, it is not harmful to make a call to this
        method with no arguments, as devices will silently ignore the request
        when there is only one alternate setting, though the USB Spec allows
        devices with no additional alternate setting return an error to the
        Host in response to a SET_INTERFACE request.

        If you are in doubt, you may want to call it with no arguments wrapped
        by a try/except clause:

        >>> try:
        >>>     dev.set_interface_altsetting()
        >>> except usb.core.USBError:
        >>>     pass
        Device.writeWrite data to the endpoint.

        The parameter data contains the data to be sent to the endpoint and
        timeout is the time limit of the operation. The transfer type and
        endpoint address are automatically inferred.

        The method returns the number of bytes written.

        For details, see the Device.write() method.
        Write data to the endpoint.

        This method is used to send data to the device. The endpoint parameter
        corresponds to the bEndpointAddress member whose endpoint you want to

        The data parameter should be a sequence like type convertible to
        the array type (see array module).

        The parameter size_or_buffer is either the number of bytes to
        read or an array object where the data will be put in and timeout is the
        time limit of the operation. The transfer type and endpoint address
        are automatically inferred.

        The method returns either an array object or the number of bytes
        actually read.

     in cygwinothers_clsExplicitly claim an interface.

    PyUSB users normally do not have to worry about interface claiming,
    as the library takes care of it automatically. But there are situations
    where you need deterministic interface claiming. For these uncommon
    cases, you can use claim_interface.

    If the interface is already claimed, either through a previously call
    to claim_interface or internally by the device object, nothing happens.
    Return the direction of a control request.

    The bmRequestType parameter is the value of the
    bmRequestType field of a control transfer.
    The possible return values are CTRL_OUT or CTRL_IN.
    find_descriptor.<locals>.desc_iter.<locals>.<genexpr>Return the endpoint direction.

    The address parameter is the bEndpointAddress field
    of the endpoint descriptor.
    The possible return values are ENDPOINT_OUT or ENDPOINT_IN.
    SPEED_FULLDESC_TYPE_INTERFACEReturn the transfer type of the endpoint.

    The bmAttributes parameter is the bmAttributes field
    of the endpoint descriptor.
    The possible return values are: ENDPOINT_TYPE_CTRL,
    ENDPOINT_TYPE_ISO, ENDPOINT_TYPE_BULK or ENDPOINT_TYPE_INTR.
    CTRL_RECIPIENT_OTHERSPEED_UNKNOWNCTRL_TYPE_CLASSCTRL_TYPE_RESERVEDSPEED_HIGHusb.util - Utility functions.

This module exports:

endpoint_address - return the endpoint absolute address.
endpoint_direction - return the endpoint transfer direction.
endpoint_type - return the endpoint type
ctrl_direction - return the direction of a control transfer
build_request_type - build a bmRequestType field of a control transfer.
find_descriptor - find an inner descriptor.
claim_interface - explicitly claim an interface.
release_interface - explicitly release an interface.
dispose_resources - release internal resources allocated by the object.
get_langids - retrieve the list of supported string languages from the device.
get_string - retrieve a string descriptor from the device.
DESC_TYPE_ENDPOINT_CTRL_DIR_MASKget_langids.<locals>.<lambda>DESC_TYPE_STRINGThe device does not support the specified langidRelease internal resources allocated by the object.

    Sometimes you need to provide deterministic resources
    freeing, for example to allow another application to
    talk to the device. As Python does not provide deterministic
    destruction, this function releases all internal resources
    allocated by the device, like device handle and interface
    policy.

    After calling this function, you can continue using the device
    object normally. If the resources will be necessary again, it
    will be allocated automatically.
    Build a bmRequestType field for control requests.

    These is a conventional function to build a bmRequestType
    for a control request.

    The direction parameter can be CTRL_OUT or CTRL_IN.
    The type parameter can be CTRL_TYPE_STANDARD, CTRL_TYPE_CLASS,
    CTRL_TYPE_VENDOR or CTRL_TYPE_RESERVED values.
    The recipient can be CTRL_RECIPIENT_DEVICE, CTRL_RECIPIENT_INTERFACE,
    CTRL_RECIPIENT_ENDPOINT or CTRL_RECIPIENT_OTHER.

    Return the bmRequestType value.
    _ENDPOINT_DIR_MASKSPEED_LOWFind an inner descriptor.

    find_descriptor works in the same way as the core.find() function does,
    but it acts on general descriptor objects. For example, suppose you
    have a Device object called dev and want a Configuration of this
    object with its bConfigurationValue equals to 1, the code would
    be like so:

    >>> cfg = util.find_descriptor(dev, bConfigurationValue=1)

    You can use any field of the Descriptor as a match criteria, and you
    can supply a customized match just like core.find() does. The
    find_descriptor function also accepts the find_all parameter to get
    an iterator instead of just one descriptor.
    Return the endpoint absolute address.

    The address parameter is the bEndpointAddress field
    of the endpoint descriptor.
    Explicitly release an interface.

    This function is used to release an interface previously claimed,
    either through a call to claim_interface or internally by the
    device object.

    Normally, you do not need to worry about claiming policies, as
    the device object takes care of it automatically.
    Retrieve the list of supported Language IDs from the device.

    Most client code should not call this function directly, but instead use
    the langids property on the Device object, which will call this function as
    needed and cache the result.

    USB LANGIDs are 16-bit integers familiar to Windows developers, where
    for example instead of en-US you say 0x0409. See the file USB_LANGIDS.pdf
    somewhere on the usb.org site for a list, which does not claim to be
    complete. It requires "system software must allow the enumeration and
    selection of LANGIDs that are not currently on this list." It also requires
    "system software should never request a LANGID not defined in the LANGID
    code array (string index = 0) presented by a device." Client code can
    check this tuple before issuing string requests for a specific language ID.

    dev is the Device object whose supported language IDs will be retrieved.

    The return value is a tuple of integer LANGIDs, possibly empty if the
    device does not support strings at all (which USB 3.1 r1.0 section
    9.6.9 allows). In that case client code should not request strings at all.

    A USBError may be raised from this function for some devices that have no
    string support, instead of returning an empty tuple. The accessor for the
    langids property on Device catches that case and supplies an empty tuple,
    so client code can ignore this detail by using the langids property instead
    of directly calling this function.
    SPEED_SUPERDESC_TYPE_DEVICE_dummy_sutf-16-leCreate a buffer to be passed to a read function.

    A read function may receive an out buffer so the data
    is read inplace and the object can be reused, avoiding
    the overhead of creating a new object at each new read
    call. This function creates a compatible sequence buffer
    of the given length.
    _ENDPOINT_TRANSFER_TYPE_MASKDESC_TYPE_CONFIG_ENDPOINT_ADDR_MASKRetrieve a string descriptor from the device.

    dev is the Device object which the string will be read from.

    index is the string descriptor index and langid is the Language
    ID of the descriptor. If langid is omitted, the string descriptor
    of the first Language ID will be returned.

    Zero is never the index of a real string. The USB spec allows a device to
    use zero in a string index field to indicate that no string is provided.
    So the caller does not have to treat that case specially, this function
    returns None if passed an index of zero, and generates no traffic
    to the device.

    The return value is the unicode string present in the descriptor, or None
    if the requested index was zero.

    It is a ValueError to request a real string (index not zero), if: the
    device's langid tuple is empty, or with an explicit langid the device does
    not support.
